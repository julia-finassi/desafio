# Squad Management Tool

## First of all I wanna say thanks for this opportunity I appreciate and I've learned a lot although I never used react before. I think about continuing try to solve all the phases later 

# Steps

## Create with npx create-react-app

## I try to build page layout but I regret using bootstrap, it was not responsive as I would like

## then I start trying to do CRUD, I try with Hooks and Context API, with axios and fetch but unsuccessfully

## Start to create other components: the containers for Top 5, Most/Less picked players

## Create football API account use x-rapid-api key to access more data but my requests ended every day, so I use SWAPI

## Install node trying to resolve a crash problem but then I have to start all over again, even getting back the version on github wasn't working

## Add Routers with react router dom 

## Search for tag inputs, with no succes to customize those tags
